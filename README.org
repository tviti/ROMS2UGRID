Convert grid and history files created by the [[https://www.myroms.org][/Regional Ocean Modeling System/]]
(ROMS), to a [[https://ugrid-conventions.github.io/][UGRID]] compliant netCDF file. The goal is to be able to post-process
ROMS outputs into a file format that can be loaded directly into [[https://qgis.org][QGIS]] as a mesh
layer.
